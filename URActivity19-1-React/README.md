# React Quiz

In this activity, we will begin by installing a few helpful packages and then explore the React documentation to answer questions.

## Instructions

### Part 1

- Begin installing Create React App globally by running the following command in your terminal:

`npx create-react-app <appname>` where `<appname>` is what you want to name your app. Example: `npx create-react-app practiceapp`.

### Part 2

- While those are installing, work with your group to answer each of the following questions using the [ReactJS Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/):

1. In the previous section we installed Create React App. What is it for?

> Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React. Create React App doesn’t handle backend logic or databases; it just creates a frontend build pipeline, so you can use it with any backend you want. Under the hood, it uses Babel and webpack, but you don’t need to know anything about them.

2. What are some benefits of using ReactJS?

> Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug. Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.

3. What is a React component? Hint: Check the "Components and Props" section of the React documentation.

> React components are small, reusable pieces of code that return a React element to be rendered to the page.

4. What is the significance of the `ReactDOM.render` method? Hint: Check the "ReactDOM" section of the documentation.

> an escape hatch to get outside of the React model if you need to

5. What is JSX? Why does Facebook recommend using it? Hint: Check the "Introducing JSX" section of the documentation.

> JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is similar to a template language, but it has full power of JavaScript. JSX gets compiled to React.createElement() calls which return plain JavaScript objects called “React elements”.

6. What does Facebook recommend as the “best way to start building a new React single page application”? Hint: Check the "Installation" section of the React documentation.

> Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

7. What is Babel? And what role does it play in converting JSX into vanilla JavaScript? Hint: Check the "Introducing JSX" section of the documentation.

8. What is the significance of { } curly braces in JSX? Hint: Check the "Introducing JSX" section of the documentation.

> The way to get values from Javascript and put them into the DOM; very similar to Handlebars except it's happening on the client-side

9. What is a component prop? Hint: Check the "Components and Props" section of the React documentation.
